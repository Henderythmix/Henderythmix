## About Me
I am a second year engineering student who currently programs with C++, Typescript, and some Lua. I can also comfortably code in Matlab, Python, and C#. I have a hobby for programming videogames, libraries, and other related projects. My current main goal is to build a game engine for 2.5D games because that is a graphical style that I have adored for years, even if it takes me forever to build something like that.

I also have a hobby for archery and music :D

## Relevant Projects
These are the projects I have completed in some form or I am still updating.

### Private Projects
These are projects that you will not be able to see the source code for, but I am also a developer in.
