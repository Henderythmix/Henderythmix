## About Me
I am a computer engineering student who currently programs with C++, and TypeScript. I can also comfortably code in Matlab, Python, and Java. I have a hobby for programming videogames, libraries, and other related projects. My current main goal is to build a game engine for 2.5D games because that is a graphical style that I have adored for years, even if it takes me forever to build something like that.

I also have a hobby for archery and music :D
